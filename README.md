# StencilJig3D

<img src="docs/stenciljig3d.JPG" width="350px"></a>

A simple yet precise stencil printing jig for small, non-framework stencils. Currently supporting PCBs with a thickness of 1.6mm and 1.0mm. The three PCB guide bars (bar1, bar2 and bar_top) can be rotated 180deg to switch between these thicknesses.

For a complete stencil jig you have to print everything once (bar1 and bar2 are actually the same object). I've chosen PLA-CF in black and red from Bambulab.
