# StencilJig3D

<img src="docs/stenciljig3d.JPG" width="350px"></a>

A simple yet precise stencil printing jig for small, non-framework stencils. The three PCB guide bars (bar1, bar2 and bar_top) can be rotated 180deg to switch between following thicknesses.

- 0.6mm & 0.8mm
- 1.0mm & 1.6mm
- 1.2mm & 2.0mm

For a complete stencil jig you have to print bar1, bar2 and bar_top with the wanted thicknesses, one base and the PCB pusher according to the bar guides (small for 0.6mm/0.8mm, normal for 1.0mm/1.6mm and big for 1.2mm/2.0mm). I've chosen PLA-CF in black and red from Bambulab.
